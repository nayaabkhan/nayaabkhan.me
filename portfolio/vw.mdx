With TIL we inspired the local community to organize more events. We formed
Vadodara Weekly to amplify other events in the town. As usual, the first step is
to design a logo.

## 1. Sketching

As this logo was for our own community, there was no client meeting. Although,
this logo was to be approved by the rest of the founders.

I started sketching some ideas down on the paper. Unfortunately, I'm not able to
find the sketches in my pad. I'll upload them once I find them,

## 2. Result

Everyone loved the mark that resembled a signal. It is yet another one of my
proud works.

      src="/portfolio/vw/variations.png"
      alt="The Vadodara Weekly logo with various colors."

And this is how it looks in action on our Instagram account.
